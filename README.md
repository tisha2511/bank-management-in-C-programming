ðŸš€ A Console-Based Bank Management System implemented in C! ðŸ’¼ðŸ’»
In this project, I've developed a robust system for managing various banking operations right from the console. It includes features such as:
âœ… View Account Details of All Accounts
âœ… Search A Particular Account
âœ… Depositing An Amount
âœ… Withdrawing An Amount
I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project as it allowed me to dive deep into the intricacies of banking systems and hone my C programming skills. ðŸ’¡
I believe that projects like these are crucial for every programmer's journey as they provide hands-on experience and reinforce theoretical knowledge.
